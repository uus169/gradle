### Public type for representing lazily evaluated properties

Because Gradle's build lifecycle clearly distinguishes between configuration phase and execution phase the evaluation of property
 values has to be deferred under certain conditions to properly capture end user input. A typical use case is the mapping of
 extension properties to custom task properties as part of a plugin implementation. In the past, many plugin developers were forced to solve evaluation order problems by using the concept of convention mapping, an internal API in Gradle subject to change.

This release of Gradle introduces a mutable type to the public API representing a property with state. The relevant interface is called [`PropertyState`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/provider/PropertyState.html). An instance of this type can be created through the method [`Project.property(Class)`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/Project.html#property-java.lang.Class-).

The following example demonstrates how to use the property state API to map an extension property to a custom task property without
running into evaluation ordering issues:

    apply plugin: GreetingPlugin

    greeting {
        message = 'Hi from Gradle'
        outputFiles = files('a.txt', 'b.txt')
    }

    class GreetingPlugin implements Plugin<Project> {
        void apply(Project project) {
            // Add the 'greeting' extension object
            def extension = project.extensions.create('greeting', GreetingPluginExtension, project)
            // Add a task that uses the configuration
            project.tasks.create('hello', Greeting) {
                message = extension.messageProvider
                outputFiles = extension.outputFiles
            }
        }
    }

    class GreetingPluginExtension {
        final PropertyState<String> message
        final ConfigurableFileCollection outputFiles

        GreetingPluginExtension(Project project) {
            message = project.property(String)
            setMessage('Hello from GreetingPlugin')
            outputFiles = project.files()
        }

        String getMessage() {
            message.get()
        }

        Provider<String> getMessageProvider() {
            message
        }

        void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }

        FileCollection getOutputFiles() {
            outputFiles
        }

        void setOutputFiles(FileCollection outputFiles) {
            this.outputFiles.setFrom(outputFiles)
        }
    }

    class Greeting extends DefaultTask {
        final PropertyState<String> message = project.property(String)
        final ConfigurableFileCollection outputFiles = project.files()

        @Input
        String getMessage() {
            message.get()
        }

        void setMessage(String message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }

        void setMessage(Provider<String> message) {
            this.message.set(message)
        }

        FileCollection getOutputFiles() {
            outputFiles
        }

        void setOutputFiles(FileCollection outputFiles) {
            this.outputFiles.setFrom(outputFiles)
        }

        @TaskAction
        void printMessage() {
            getOutputFiles().each {
                it.text = getMessage()
            }
        }
    }

### Build Cache Improvements

#### Remote build cache honors `--offline` 

When running with `--offline`, Gradle will disable the remote build cache.

#### Detecting overlapping task outputs

When two tasks write into the same directory, Gradle will now disable task output caching for the second task to execute. This prevents issues where task outputs for a different task are captured for the wrong build cache key. On subsequent builds, if overlapping outputs are detected, Gradle will also prevent you from loading task outputs from the cache if it would remove existing outputs from another task.

You can diagnose overlapping task output issues by running Gradle at the `--info` log level. If you are using [Gradle Build Scans](https://gradle.com/scans/get-started), the same detailed reason for disabling task output caching will be included in the build timeline. 

### Default Zinc compiler upgraded from 0.3.7 to 0.3.13

This will take advantage of performance optimizations in the latest [Zinc](https://github.com/typesafehub/zinc) releases.

## Promoted features

Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of Gradle but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility.
See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the features that have been promoted in this Gradle release.

## Fixed issues

## Deprecations

Features that have become superseded or irrelevant due to the natural evolution of Gradle become *deprecated*, and scheduled to be removed
in the next major Gradle version (Gradle 4.0). See the User guide section on the “[Feature Lifecycle](userguide/feature_lifecycle.html)” for more information.

The following are the newly deprecated items in this Gradle release. If you have concerns about a deprecation, please raise it via the [Gradle Forums](https://discuss.gradle.org).

The deprecated `jetty` plugin has been removed. We recommend using the [Gretty plugin](https://github.com/akhikhl/gretty) for developing Java web applications.
The deprecated `pluginRepositories` block for declaring custom plugin repositories has been removed in favor of `pluginManagement.repositories`.
